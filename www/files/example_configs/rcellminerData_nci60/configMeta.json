Included are those variants defined as missense, nonsense, splice-sense, frameshift, read-through, non-frameshift insertions or deletions. Not included are variants found in more than 13 cell lines. In addition, variants must be absent from both the 1000 Genomes and ESP5400, and at least one  of the following conditions must be true: 1) if there is a sift score it must be less than or equal to 0.05; 2) if there is a polyphen score it must be greater than or equal to 0.85; or 3) the variant type must be defined as either a nonsense, splice-sense, or frameshift.",
